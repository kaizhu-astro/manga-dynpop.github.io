The MaNGA DynPop catalogs are publicly available on [Github][1], including the stellar dynamical properties and the stellar population properties. The stellar dynamical properties are obtained using the well-established Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method ([Cappellari 2008][Cappellari2008],[Cappellari 2020][Cappellari2020]). The stellar population properties are obtained from the stellar population synthesis (SPS) models.

### Paper I

The JAM catalog file `SDSSDR17_MaNGA_JAM.fits` and the data model file `SDSSDR17_MaNGA_JAM_datamodel.pdf` can be downloaded from [here][2].

The supplementary files including the fitting qualities, MGE models, and the mass profiles will be released soon.

### Paper II
The SPS catalog files can be downloaded from [here][3] (will be released soon).
